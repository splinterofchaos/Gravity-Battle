# How many particles to spawn, proportionate to the exploder's mass.
# It the game runs slowly after a collision, this is the variable to turn down.

# How should particles behave? 
# simple: particles will move in straight lines until off screen.
#         Use this option if you encounter performance problems.
# orbit:  particles will orbit attractors.
# gravity-field: Particles will display showing their gravitational pulls.

# PATH PREDICTION #

# A prediction line, showing the path enemies will fallow, can be drawn to help
# beginners learn how to play and manipulate enemies.

# How time increments to predict. To turn the prediction line off, set this to
# 0.  Setting it too high may cause slow down or crash, but it can look pretty
# interesting if you set it to different values. Try 1000, 50, etc.
